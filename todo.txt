Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

**Base**
- added press A to see entire (or at least more of) truncated option description

**Extras**
- 

-------------------------------

create a clean image to flash and install over
	advanced users seem to be confused about how simple it is to install :sweat_smile:
	this might be difficult with the gpio revs on newer devices

add most recent uImage/kernel changes
	wait till things settle

hdmi
	minarch menu
		need to figure out how to create a 4:3 thumb from a distorted framebuffer
		should be able to reconstruct it with screen->w|h and renderer.(src|dst)_(w|h)
			just need to downsample to a cropped region of the source
	ignore brightness shortcut when on hdmi
		still getting through somehow...
	audio

minarch
	pressing A on an option shows the whole description?
		gambatte's descriptions are so long this will require scrolling
		which I have the design for but...
		also my current wrapText implementation always puts the last word on a new line :sob:
		it's not important enough for all this :joy:
	move overrides to a text file that lives in the pak?
		that way I don't have to update minarch to support new cores?
		that requires allocations...
		wait, we could just use the existing cfg format
			except extend that to include `-` prefix to lock/hide an option?
	
	can I support changing discs in multi-disc pbps?
	figure out how to handle different button mappings for cores with different modes
		eg. GG or SMS with picodrive
	also different defaults
	
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up

minui
	- 

misc
	port Random Game.pak + daemon
	port say, show, blank, and confirm
	make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

checkout eggs tools
	I wonder if I could patch in Commander-11, BPreplayBold is too bold at that size

cores
	pce
		disable Alternate Turbo Hotkey (we don't have L3/R3)
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the
		framerate
		conversely aspect runs terrible on hdmi (~45fps) but native runs fine
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding
			actually, ff may be an issue for this core across the board

	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

makefile
	-
	
sdl
	-

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
	hdmi
		turn off screen when connected
		fb changes... eek
