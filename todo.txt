Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

**Base**
- added press A to see entire (or at least more of) truncated option description
- fixed controls being overwritten by core defaults

**Extras**
- disabled TurboGrafx-16 option Alternate Turbo Toggle (device doesn't have the buttons used for it, L3/R3)

-------------------------------

minarch
	move overrides to a text cfg file that lives in the pak
		that way I don't have to update minarch to support new cores
		this will solve the following two (three?) items too
		will need to make getEmuPath() a util function
		this will also solve the union platform overrides problem
	figure out how to handle different button mappings for cores with different modes
		eg. GG or SMS with picodrive
	also different defaults
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
		
		



		mid-rewrite
		GG, SMS, and PKM (at least) all crash on launch
		add default.cfg to all extra paks
		revisit default.cfg of all paks that share a core to ensure they have the best defaults for their specific purpose
			eg. MGBA vs SGB, GB vs GBC, MD vs GG vs SMS
		finally delete the overrides folder
		delete CoreOverrides and move OptionOverride and ButtonMapping structs into main.c
		
		
		
	
	hide Restore defaults if currently using defaults?
	
	can I support changing discs in multi-disc pbps?
	
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up
		I should probably rewrite the entire render pipeline now that I better understand
		the requirements for resolution independence...

add most recent uImage/kernel changes
	wait till things settle

hdmi
	minarch menu
		need to figure out how to create a 4:3 thumb from a distorted framebuffer
		should be able to reconstruct it with screen->w|h and renderer.(src|dst)_(w|h)
			just need to downsample to a cropped region of the source
	ignore brightness shortcut when on hdmi
		still getting through somehow...
	audio


create a clean image to flash and install over
	advanced users seem to be confused about how simple it is to install :sweat_smile:
	this might be difficult with the gpio revs on newer devices


minui
	- 

misc
	port Random Game.pak + daemon
	port say, show, blank, and confirm
	make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

checkout eggs tools
	I wonder if I could patch in Commander-11, BPreplayBold is too bold at that size

cores
	pce
		disable Alternate Turbo Hotkey (we don't have L3/R3)
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the
		framerate
		conversely aspect runs terrible on hdmi (~45fps) but native runs fine
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding
			actually, ff may be an issue for this core across the board

	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

makefile
	-
	
sdl
	-

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
	hdmi
		turn off screen when connected
		fb changes... eek
