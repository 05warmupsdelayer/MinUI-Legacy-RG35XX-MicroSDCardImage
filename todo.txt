- added PCE.pak for TurboGrafx-16

-------------------------------

create a clean image to flash and install over
	- advanced users seem to be confused about how simple it is to install :sweat_smile:

hdmi
	for now I could add to a user auto.sh
		cat /sys/class/switch/hdmi/state
		echo 1 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mirror_to_hdmi

minarch

	cores with different modes that report different inputs break with overrides
		eg. GG or SMS with picodrive
		kinda related SGB (with mgba) uses GBA button naming (and turbo)
		is there a way to detect the mode in the env callback??
		move overrides to a text file that lives in the pack?
			that way I don't have to update minarch to support new cores?
			also buttons should be bound RA_ID => MIN_ID not DISPLAY_NAME => MIN_ID

	related to above
		bindings for shortcuts should also use something less brittle than the display name
		
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up

minui
	- 

misc
	port say, show, blank, and confirm
	make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

checkout eggs tools
	I wonder if I could patch in Commander-11, BPreplayBold is too bold at that size

cores
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the
		framerate
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding

	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

makefile
	-
	
sdl
	-

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
	hdmi
		turn off screen when connected
		fb changes... eek
