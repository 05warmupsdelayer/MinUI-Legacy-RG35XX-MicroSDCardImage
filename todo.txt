Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

**Base**
- updated various frontend and emulator option default values
- added press A to see entire (or at least more of) truncated option description
- fixed controls being overridden by core defaults

**Extras**
- updated various frontend and emulator option default values
- disabled TurboGrafx-16 option Alternate Turbo Toggle (device doesn't have the buttons used for it, L3/R3)

-------------------------------

minarch
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
		Boost FF Off|On
			Prioritize speed when fast forwarding by disabling tearing prevention and increasing CPU speed.
			
			SFC (2x with) (Star Fox still only hits 1.5x with)
			MGBA (2x with) (SGB is fine without)
			FC (2x without, 2.66x with)
			PS (depends on game, without FFVII gets 4x, SotN only 2x, Tekken 3 just crashes)
			SUPA (Starfox 1.5x with)
			VB (can't be helped, already needs Performance)
	
	can I support changing discs in multi-disc pbps?
	
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
		
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up
		I should probably rewrite the entire render pipeline now that I better understand
		the requirements for resolution independence...
		and because I'll need a self-contained implementation to be able to address the unique quirks of each platform I want to support

add most recent uImage/kernel changes
	wait till things settle
	keep an eye on gpu work
		not interested in tripling boot time for gpu access
		I would never pick up the device again if it took that long to boot

hdmi
	prevent sleep (auto or manual) when on hdmi (or turn off mirroring?)
	minarch menu
		need to figure out how to create a 4:3 thumb from a distorted framebuffer
		should be able to reconstruct it with screen->w|h and renderer.(src|dst)_(w|h)
			just need to downsample to a cropped region of the source
	ignore brightness shortcut when on hdmi
		still getting through somehow...
	audio
	usb contollers


create a clean image to flash and install over
	advanced users seem to be confused about how simple it is tow install :sweat_smile:
	this might be difficult with the gpio revs on newer devices


minui
	- 

misc
	port Random Game.pak + daemon
	port say, show, blank, and confirm
	make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

checkout eggs tools
	I wonder if I could patch in Commander-11, BPreplayBold is too bold at that size

cores
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the framerate
		conversely aspect runs terrible on hdmi (~45fps) but native runs fine
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken 3 freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding after a while

	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

makefile
	-
	
sdl
	-

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
	hdmi
		turn off screen when connected
		fb changes... eek
