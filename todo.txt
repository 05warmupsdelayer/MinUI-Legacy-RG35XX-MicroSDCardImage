-------------------------------

Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

*base*
- fixed input mapping for cores with different input modes
- fixed late loading of configs (was preventing boot logos for certain systems)
- fixed flicker at low end of screen brightness ramp
- restored PlayStation interlace and enhanced resolutions options

*extras*
- added GG.pak for Game Gear
- added SMS.pak for Master System
- restored Game Boy Player rumble support in MGBA.pak (some games had rumble hardware on the cartridge, others depended on the Game Cube's and require this toggle to access it)
- added SGB.pak for Super Game Boy
- added PCE.pak for TurboGrafx-16

create a clean image to flash and install over
	advanced users seem to be confused about how simple it is to install :sweat_smile:

add most recent uImage/kernel changes

hdmi
	for now I could add to a user auto.sh
		cat /sys/class/switch/hdmi/state
		echo 1 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/mirror_to_hdmi
		if connected to hdmi switch to aspect (if native)
		and resize to address stretching 640x480 to 1280x720
	ignore brightness shortcut when on hdmi

minarch
	figure out how to handle different button mappings for cores with different modes
		eg. GG or SMS with picodrive
	move overrides to a text file that lives in the pak?
		that way I don't have to update minarch to support new cores?
	
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up

minui
	- 

misc
	port say, show, blank, and confirm
	make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

checkout eggs tools
	I wonder if I could patch in Commander-11, BPreplayBold is too bold at that size

cores
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the
		framerate
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding

	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

makefile
	-
	
sdl
	-

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
	hdmi
		turn off screen when connected
		fb changes... eek
