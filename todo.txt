	decide on a repo name
		union-minui?
	
rewrite/add repo url
	BASE/README.txt
	EXTRAS/README.txt

minarch
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up

minui
	- 

common
	move battery check to thread?

misc
	say, show, blank, and confirm

checkout eggs tools
	I wonder if I could patch in Commander-11, BPreplayBold is too bold at that size

cores
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the framerate
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding

	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

	
makefile
	add commits.txt?

make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

send neonloop a link to minarch source

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
	hdmi
		turn off screen when connected
		fb changes... eek


todont
	I thought I wanted the MENU button to act as a back button in OPTIONS submenus
	but then why doesn't it act as a back button in the main menu?
	it's a toggle, it toggles the menu in game and the version info in main menu
