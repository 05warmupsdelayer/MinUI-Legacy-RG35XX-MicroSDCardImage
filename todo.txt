Please see the README.txt in the zip file for installation and update instructions.

**Base**
- removed incomplete hdmi support (won't support codepaths I won't use, ergonomics are all wrong)
- restored low battery overlay

**Extras**
- 

-------------------------------

bugs
	- 

api
	battery ramp is wrong for bigger battery
		need to log drain
	rewrite scaling logic
	rewrite overlay
	move scanlines/grid to overlay?
	
more regressions
	slow power led
	prevents power on with more than enough power

	
minarch
	some cores can only fast forward with prevent tearing off
		can this be set as an override preference?
		Boost FF Off|On
			Prioritize speed when fast forwarding by disabling tearing prevention and increasing CPU speed.
			
			SFC (2x with) (Star Fox still only hits 1.5x with)
			MGBA (2x with) (SGB is fine without)
			FC (2x without, 2.66x with)
			PS (depends on game, without FFVII gets 4x, SotN only 2x, Tekken 3 just crashes)
			SUPA (Starfox 1.5x with)
			VB (can't be helped, already needs Performance)
	
	can I support changing discs in multi-disc pbps?
	
	change Frontend > Scanlines/Grid to Screen Effect (None, Scanlines, Grid, LCD)
		and Shortcuts > Toggle Scanlines to Cycle Effect
		or don't because my cpu scalers are bad (performance-wise)
		or flesh them out just because :sweat_smile:
		
	eggs implemented mixed scale neon scalers, hook those up
		I should probably rewrite the entire render pipeline now that I better understand
		the requirements for resolution independence...
		and because I'll need a self-contained implementation to be able to address the unique quirks of each platform I want to support

minui
	- 

misc
	port Random Game.pak + daemon
	port say, show, blank, and confirm
	make my own simple file browser? :sweat_smile:

commander
	create a commander-11-mono for text views?

cores
	vb
		launching directly into native scaling has normal performance
		but launching into aspect and switching to native tanks the framerate
	pcsx-rearmed
		reset hangs the PlayStation emulator core
		Tekken 3 freezes PlayStation emulator core while fast-forwarding after a while

	cave story
		would need to set up disabling autosleep and 
		warning about lack of autosave and 
		update ui for lack of save states, etc
		blech, getting pretty tired of all of this
	
	
Union-ize this?
	Mini?
	Smart & Model S?

makefile
	-
	
sdl
	-

batmon
	charging icons at least?
		ramdisk.img/res/images/charger/battery_[0-5].png

clock
	-

libmsettings
	hdmi

keymon
	handle sleep/wake
		minui/minarch would opt out of this
		would be useful for Files.pak and third-party binaries
	jack
		instead of manually polling once a second use poll()?
