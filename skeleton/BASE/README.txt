Roms

Included in this zip is a Roms folder containing folders for each console MinUI currently supports. You can rename these folders but you must keep the uppercase tag name in parentheses in order to retain the mapping to the correct emulator (eg. "Nintendo Entertainment System (FC)" could be renamed to "Nintendo (FC)", "NES (FC)", or "Famicom (FC)"). 

You should probably preload these folders with roms and copy each one to the Roms folder on your SD card before installing. Or not, I'm not the boss of you.

When one or more folder share the same display name (eg. "Game Boy Advance (GBA)" and "Game Boy Advance (MGBA)") they will be combined into a single menu item containing the roms from both folders (continuing the previous example, "Game Boy Advance"). This allows opening specific roms with an alternate pak.

----------------------------------------
Bios

Some emulators require or perform much better with official bios. MinUI is strictly BYOB. Place the bios for each system in a folder that matches the tag in the corresponding Roms folder name (eg. bios for "Sony PlayStation (PS)" roms goes in "/Bios/PS/"),

Bios file names are case-sensitive:

   FC: disksys.rom
   GB: gb_bios.bin
  GBA: gba_bios.bin
  GBC: gbc_bios.bin
   PS: psxonpsp660.bin

Disc-based games

To streamline launching multi-file disc-based games with MinUI place your bin/cue (and/or iso/wav files) in a folder with the same name as the cue file. MinUI will automatically launch the cue file instead of navigating into the folder when selected, eg. 

  Harmful Park (English v1.0)/
    Harmful Park (English v1.0).bin
    Harmful Park (English v1.0).cue

For multi-disc games, put all the files for all the discs in a single folder and create an m3u file (just a text file containing the relative path to each disc's cue file on a separate line) with the same name as the folder. Instead of showing the entire messy contents of the folder, MinUI will launch the appropriate cue file, eg. For a Policenauts folder structured like this:

  Policenauts (English v1.0)/
    Policenauts (English v1.0).m3u
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 1).bin
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 1).cue
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 2).bin
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 2).cue

the m3u file would contain just:

  Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 1).cue
  Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 2).cue

MinUI also reportedly supports chd files and official pbp files (multi-disc pbp files larger than 2GB are not supported).

----------------------------------------
Collections

A collection is just a text file containing an ordered list of full paths to rom, cue, or m3u files. These text files live in the Collections folder at the root of your SD card, eg. "/Collections/Metroid series.txt" might look like this:

  /Roms/GBA/Metroid Zero Mission.gba
  /Roms/GB/Metroid II.gb
  /Roms/SNES (SFC)/Super Metroid.sfc
  /Roms/GBA/Metroid Fusion.gba

----------------------------------------
Advanced

MinUI can automatically run a user-authored shell script on boot. Just place a file named "auto.sh" to "/.userdata/".
